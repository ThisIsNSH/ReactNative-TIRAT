### Used

* React Native
* Expo
* ObjectiveC Xcode
* Java AndroidStudio

* IBM Watson API

### Functionality

* Initially user clicks or selects an image from camera roll and app gets the base64 string.
* This base64 string is passed as the body in Google Cloud Vision API to get the text and language in it. 
* The app routes to translation screen where initially all supported languages are fetched from IBM Watson language-translate API.
* User then can pick any language from the list and the translations are shown which are fetched from IBM Watson Language-Translate API for all text instances found by Cloud Vision API.
